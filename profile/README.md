<h1 align="center">Carolina Analytics and Data Science</h1>

**[Carolina Analytics & Data Science (CADS)](https://carolinadata.unc.edu)** is the **largest data science student organization** at UNC-Chapel Hill! CADS is concerned with providing students interested in Data Science opportunities to grow *personally*, *intellectually*, *professionally*, and *socially* among a support network of students, professors, and professionals. This mission is to be accomplished through events, including a speaker series from industry professionals, data case competition, workshops, and investigating and analyzing University and community data to drive community-based projects and solutions.

CADS also runs the **[Carolina Data Challenge (CDC)](https://cdcunc.com)**, UNC's annual data science hackathon. CDC welcomes hundreds of students every year. Participants will be able to work on a data science project in teams, attend workshops, interact with our sponsors at the sponsorship fair, and win cool prizes.
